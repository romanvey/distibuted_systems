But if one node be stopped, for replica factor 1 it would be error: "NoHostAvailable:" for consistency level: ONE, TWO, THREE, QUORUM, ALL
But if one node be stopped, for replica factor 2 it would be error: "NoHostAvailable:" for consistency level: TWO, THREE, QUORUM, ALL
But if one node be stopped, for replica factor 3 it would be error: "NoHostAvailable:" for consistency all levels
